Maybe it&#x27;s adding copy to the website or putting out a tweet — depending on job function. <strong class="">Make this the norm every day for their first week</strong>. Ask them to turn something in or put something out by a certain time. Observe their bias toward action and how promptly they hit their mark. If you start things with this cadence and expectation, it&#x27;s more likely to continue. This shortens the cycle it takes for someone to build up reliability.</p><p data-label="Paragraph" class="

Raimondi immediately volunteered to go through all this data, batch and analyze it. This freed up everyone else to keep bug fixing, and gave Raimondi herself amazing insight into the product — which enhanced her credibility too.</p><p data-label="Pullquote" class="

You don&#x27;t have to accuse them directly, but rather say: &quot;<strong class="">I wouldn&#x27;t have assumed you&#x27;d do or say X or Y. Can you tell me more about why you did?</strong>&quot; Be willing to be authentic with them, share what you’re excited about at the company and what you worry about. Ask them to do the same in return. Having the wrong expectations about someone can sometimes masquerade as them seeming inauthentic, so check your own assumptions first. How valid are they, really?</p><p data-label="Paragraph" class="

            "><strong class="">Perhaps the best way to be authentic: Stay in consistent, responsive communication.</strong> (This also helps with reliability and credibility.) The prime example here is a founder wanting to maintain the trust of their board and investors. Holding yourself to a schedule for sending weekly company updates and materials (before meetings) and recaps (right after) will enhance your authenticity as a leader. Your stakeholders will know what&#x27;s top of mind for you and why at every beat along the way, and they&#x27;ll trust you&#x27;re on top of things. The same goes for your employees — over-communicate to bring them along with you.</p><p data-label="Pullquote" class="

Even if they&#x27;re tiny, they provide much-appreciated connective tissue between them and the company. He also uses it as an opportunity to share a few personal updates from him and his team, and to congratulate board members on important personal developments like anniversaries, birthdays, etc. This helps them acknowledge and feel like they know each other even better as people, not just colleagues. It paints a fuller picture of what matters to all of them inside and outside the office.</p><p data-label="Paragraph" class="

Hosting team lunches, celebrating baby showers, and letting people share what they value in their personal lives makes a distinct difference. One leader Raimondi admires kicks off team meetings with personal announcements accompanied by photos from employees&#x27; recent travel or of a baby&#x27;s first steps.

Assign numbers to the variables in the equation. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re rating the person&#x27;s credibility, reliability, authenticity and self interest on a scale of 1 to 10. See where you net out (and of course keep it to yourself). This can help crystallize your thinking and remove some of the heated emotion. By assigning points, you also have to recognize what someone is doing well, not just what they&#x27;re doing poorly, too.</p><p data-label="Paragraph" class="
